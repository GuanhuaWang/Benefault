A way for task preemption in Big data analytics platform
## What we have done
### We have already done some simulation about the JCT gain we can get using Benefault
### We test latency in varied scenarios
* Measure checkpoint latency using Spark
* Word Count with checkpointing
* Sorting with checkpoint
* GroupByKey with Checkpointing
* DecisionTree with periodic Checkpointing
* We now design schemes for evaluate best gain we can get using Benefault
